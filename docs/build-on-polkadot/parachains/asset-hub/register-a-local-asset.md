# Register a local asset on Asset Hub

## Introduction
As detailed in the [Asset Hub Overview](./overview.md#local-assets){target=_blank} page, Asset Hub accommodates two types of assets: local and foreign. Local assets are those that were created in Asset Hub and are identifiable by an integer ID. This guide will take you through the steps of registering a local asset on the Asset Hub parachain.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have access to the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/){target=_blank} interface and a Polkadot.js account with a balance of DOT or KSM. For Polkadot Asset Hub, you would need a deposit of 10 DOT and around 0.201 DOT for the metadata. Before you create an asset on the Asset Hub, ensure that your Asset Hub account balance is a bit more than the sum of those two deposits, which should seamlessly account for the required deposits and transaction fees. For Kusama Asset Hub, the deposit is 0.100000 KSM and around 0.000669 KSM for the metadata
