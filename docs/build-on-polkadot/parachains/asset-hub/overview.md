# Asset Hub

## Introduction

The Asset Hub [System Parachain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-system-chains){target=_blank} is designed to manage and operate assets within the Polkadot network. It specializes in creating, managing, and using assets. While other parachains can also handle assets, the Asset Hub is considered the primary hub for asset operations in the network.

DOT is the native token used in the Asset Hub. This parachain defers its governance to the parent Relay Chain and does not feature inflation or era-based rewards for collators. However, collators do earn a portion of the transaction fees. As a system parachain, the Asset Hub maintains a trusted relationship with the Relay Chain, enabling it to transfer DOT between the two. Consequently, DOT on the Asset Hub is equivalent to DOT on the Relay Chain.
