# Asset Hub

## Introduction

Asset Hub is a [System Parachain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-system-chains){target=_blank} designed to manage and operate assets within the Polkadot network. It specializes in creating, managing, and using assets and is considered the primary hub for asset operations in the network. 

DOT is the native token used in the Asset Hub, and it maintains a trusted relationship with the Relay Chain, enabling it to transfer DOT between the two.

## Assets

An asset on the blockchain is a digital representation of value, such as cryptocurrencies and tokens, that can be transferred and traded. On Asset Hub, assets are stored as a map from an ID to information about the asset, including details about the management team, total supply, and other relevant information. 

The [Asset Pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_assets/index.html){target=_blank}  facilitates the management of these assets by providing essential functions for handling them.
