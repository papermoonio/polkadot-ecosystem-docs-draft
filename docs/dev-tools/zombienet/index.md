# Zombienet

## Introduction

ZombieNet is a testing framework designed for Substrate-based blockchains. It provides a simple CLI tool for creating and testing blockchain environments locally or across networks. It supports various backend providers, including Kubernetes, Podman, and native setups for running blockchain nodes. The framework enables developers to create tests using natural language tools, allowing them to verify on-chain storage, metrics, logs, and custom interactions with the blockchain. It is particularly effective for setting up local relay chains with validators and parachains with collators.

This framework has been designed and developed by [Parity Technologies]({{ https://www.parity.io/ }}){target=_blanket}, and currently mantained by the Network Simulation team. For further support and information, please refer to the [TODO: add oficial contact point for zombienet]({{ . }}){target=_blanket}
