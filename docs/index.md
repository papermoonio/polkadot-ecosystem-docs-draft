# Polkadot Ecosystem Documentation

Welcome to the documentation site for Polkadot, the first layer-0 (L0) blockchain that provides shared security and secure interoperability to layer-1 (L1) blockchains. 

## What is Polkadot? {: #what-is-polkadot }

Polkadot is a layer-0 (L0) blockchain connecting a network of purpose-built level-1 (L1) blockchains, allowing them to operate seamlessly together at scale. Polkadot allows specialized blockchains to focus on their area of expertise without the L1 worrying about security or how to connect to and exchange data with other blockchains.
