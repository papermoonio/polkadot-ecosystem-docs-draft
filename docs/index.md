# Polkadot Ecosystem Documentation

Welcome to a draft documentation site for ecosystem-related things on Polkadot, a scalable, interoperable, and secure network empowering the next generation of web builders. This site aims to serve as a central knowledge exchange for teams across the Polkadot ecosystem.

Here's what you'll be able to find in the documentation:

- A deep dive into Polkadot - Get familiar with Polkadot's architecture, inner workings, and core technologies, including Agile Coretime, XCM, bridges, governance, and more
- Resources for parachain development - Learn how to create, test, and deploy a parachain from scratch using Substrate and explore how to build and customize your runtime, including adding pallets and implementing custom logic
- Parachain tooling - Access specialized tools and frameworks to streamline parachain development, from launch to maintenance
- Documentation on smart contract development - Find resources and tutorials on developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts using Solidity and ink! on Polkadot's EVM and other supported EVM environments in the ecosystem
- Ecosystem tooling - Discover a suite of powerful tools, including SDKs, APIs, and other resources, to build scalable, interoperable applications on Polkadot
- Information on running infrastructure - Infrastructure providers can find detailed information on operating and maintaining validator nodes, including block production, transaction validation, and ensuring network security

These resources provide practical benefits and best practices for working with smart contracts, pallets, and Substrate and offer guidance for those building tooling and running infrastructure.
